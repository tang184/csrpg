Deployment
----------

The author of ``websockets`` isn't aware of best practices for deploying
network services based on :mod:`asyncio`.

He suggests running a Python script similar to the :ref:`server example
<server-example>`, perhaps inside a supervisor if you deem it useful.

If you can share knowledge on this topic, please file an issue_. Thanks!
